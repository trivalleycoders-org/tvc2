# TVC.STATIC

## Purpose
Initial a mock-up and then a temporary static site until the actual site is ready.

## Current State 29Apr17
Pretty ugly but starting to put the pieces together.

## Current Goals
1. Decide what content the site should have
1. Write copy/text which I'm not much good at so suggestions desired
1. Find a template that the team thinks is agreeable or fix-up the current one

## Current Proposed Sections
(In order of desired prominence)
1. Title
1. Brief description
1. Technologies
1. Projects
1. Team members
1. ??


## Work Needed
1. Decide layout (sidebars?)
2. Fix up technology stack icons (see /img/logos). Size needs to be standardized and all should have white titles
3. Spacing / margins & alignment
4. Add 'Technologies' to menu - maybe
